This is where the bot starts to learn.

If the bot can't find a response to your input, it ends
up here. Your original input is stored as an AIML predicate
called 'meaning', an AIML file is generated to handle your 
reply and this is then 'learnt' by the bot in anticipation 
of a sensible explanation. Another AIML predicate is then
set so that the correct training method is called when the 
next IM is received.
