the files:
google.py
wikipedia.py
wiktionary.py

are based off the googlism.py as a template... these scripts still need to be edited.
once they are fully functional, they will need to be added to the 
tools or ask-howie-aiml file.

also in the future i would like to add the following option scirpts...

google.books.com
sacred-texts.com
britannica.com
hulu.com
netflix.com
amazon.com
